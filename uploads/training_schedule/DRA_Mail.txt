As per discussion between Rucha and Datta sir, kindly find my understanding on below points and provide confirmation on same so as to start the changes.

The process of adding/modifying of “DRA Training Applicants Form” After the batch is approved by the admin e.g given below for clarity:

Sr.No.   Batch Code         Hours    Center Name     Batch From & To Date                   Total Applications           Batch Creation Date    Batch Status       Action
1              BTCH110987       50           Kolkata                 09-Jul-2023 To 18-Jul-2023                          36                           06-07-2023                                Go Ahead


1)	The above batch is created on 6-Jul-2023 and the batch is also approved on 6-Jul-2023.
2)	For the above batch addition/modification of “Part 1”   and “Part 2” will start from 6-Jul-2023 (approval date)

4)	The addition/modification for “Part 2” will stop EOD of 11-Jul-2023: 23.59 hrs (3 working days from batch start date). Assumption no holidays/Sunday between 9-Jul and 11-Jul.
